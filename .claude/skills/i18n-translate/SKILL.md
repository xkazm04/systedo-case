# i18n-translate — copywriting-grade, context-aware localization

Translate an app's source-language catalog into its other locales the way a
bilingual copywriter on the product team would — not a machine. The job is to
make each non-source locale read as if it were written first in that language,
in the product's voice, using the right domain terms, and never breaking the
format contract the target repo's build enforces.

This is a **transcreation** loop with an engineering guardrail, not a
find-and-replace. Word-for-word is the failure mode.

This skill is **portable**: nothing repo-specific lives in this file. Every
repo-specific fact — where the catalogs are, what the placeholder syntax is,
which commands gate correctness — lives in the target repo's
`docs/i18n/contract.md`, which the first run bootstraps (Phase 0). The method
below is the same everywhere; the contract is not.

---

## When to use

- "Translate the app to X" / "add language X" (a new locale).
- "Review/improve the Czech (or any) translations."
- "The German is machine-y, make it read natively."
- A periodic sweep for strings that drifted out of parity, were added in the
  source language only, or sit in a locale file as verbatim source-language text.

## When NOT to use

- Adding/renaming **source-language** keys — that's normal feature work. This
  skill *consumes* the source catalog as truth; it doesn't invent source copy.
  If the source copy is wrong or ambiguous, flag it, don't silently rewrite it.
- Non-user-facing strings: backend logs, telemetry breadcrumbs, console output.
- Content owned by another subsystem (e.g. email/SMS template bodies living
  outside the catalog) unless the contract says they're in scope.

---

## Phase 0 — the repo contract (`docs/i18n/contract.md`)

**Read it first. If it doesn't exist, discover and write it before translating
anything.** The contract is the repo-specific half of this skill: what would be
hardcoded in a vendored copy. It must answer, with verified paths and commands:

1. **Catalog layout** — where locale files live, which locale is the source of
   truth, how keys are structured (nested vs flat, sections/namespaces).
2. **Format system** — ICU MessageFormat? A bare `{var}` regex interpolator?
   gettext? Suffixed plural keys (`_one`/`_other`) selected by the call site?
   Spell out exactly what a translator may and may not touch: placeholder
   names, plural/select keywords, rich-tag names, HTML, emoji, separators.
3. **Plural mechanism** — whether the translator *expands* plural branches to
   the target language's CLDR categories (ICU) or the key set is **frozen** and
   a missing category must be *flagged*, never faked (suffixed keys).
4. **Fallback behavior** — does a missing/untranslated key fall back to the
   source language *silently*? If yes, key parity proves nothing about
   translatedness, and the `gaps` mode + an untranslated-values check are
   load-bearing.
5. **The gates** — every command that must pass before finishing (parity/ICU
   checks, typecheck, untranslated-value scan), plus any **post-edit build
   step** without which the edit is a silent no-op (e.g. a chunk-splitting or
   codegen script the runtime actually loads from).
6. **Do-not-translate seeds** — brand names, product proper nouns, technical
   identifiers; note any product-name-vs-common-noun traps ("Personas" the app
   vs "personas" the plural noun — judge by call site, not spelling).
7. **Call-site lookup** — how to find where a key renders (the `t()` idiom to
   grep for).
8. **Operational notes** — worktree/parallel-safety rules, dead-key detection,
   anything "learned the hard way" in this repo.

To discover it: read the i18n runtime source (the `t()` implementation and the
interpolator tell you the real rules, whatever the docs claim), the check
scripts, `package.json` scripts, and any existing `docs/i18n/`. Verify each
claim against code before writing it down. When a later run finds the contract
wrong or stale, fix the contract in the same change — it is a doc like any
other.

---

## The four artifacts (create once, maintain forever)

The memory that makes run N+1 consistent with run N. All live in the target
repo under `docs/i18n/` — they are project truth, not skill-internal state:

1. **`contract.md`** — the engineering contract (Phase 0, above).
2. **`glossary.md`** — the termbase. *What to call things.* One canonical
   translation per domain term per locale, plus the Do-Not-Translate list.
   Seed it from the product's domain nouns on bootstrap; add a row whenever you
   make a term decision mid-run so it sticks. One decision per term, applied
   everywhere.
3. **`style-<locale>.md`** — the voice guide. *How to sound.* Register (a B2B
   or developer tool usually takes formal address: Czech *vykání*, German
   *Sie*, French *vous*, Japanese *です・ます*), sentence case vs Title Case
   (most non-English UIs use sentence case), punctuation/typography (Czech
   `„…"` quotes, French narrow NBSP before `;:!?` and `« »` guillemets, CJK
   full-width punctuation, real ellipsis `…`, NBSP conventions), tone, loanword
   policy (decide per term IN THE GLOSSARY, be consistent), grammar traps a
   mechanical translation gets wrong (number agreement, aspect, gender for
   unknown referents), and length discipline for UI chrome.
4. **`exemplars-<locale>.md`** — the gold pairs. *Register by demonstration.*
   ~8 source→locale pairs harvested from the locale's best already-reviewed
   strings, one per string class: button/CTA, heading, tooltip, error/status,
   empty-state **transcreation** (the money example — show the rhythm, not the
   words), a correctly localized plural, a public/end-user-facing string, a
   legal/consent string. Each pair carries a one-line "why this is right" note.
   In-domain exemplars are the best-evidenced quality lever after the glossary —
   a style guide *describes* the voice, exemplars *demonstrate* it. Keep the
   file at ~8; replace a pair only when a better one ships.

Before translating anything, **read all four**. Bootstrap any that are missing
(for exemplars on a brand-new locale: translate the 8 class-examples first,
polish them hard, seed the file from those).

---

## Modes (dispatch on the argument)

- **`review <locale> [scope]`** — audit EXISTING translations and fix them.
  The default when a locale already exists. `review` = Pass B + Pass C only.
  Optional key-prefix scope (e.g. `pipeline.controlCenter`).
- **`gaps [locale|all]`** — translate values that are still verbatim source
  language. Only meaningful when the contract says fallback is silent — there,
  **run `gaps` before `review`**: a polished 76% under a raw-English 24% is the
  wrong order.
- **`full <locale>`** — (re)translate every key for one locale (Pass A → B → C).
- **`sync [locale|all]`** — the incremental heartbeat: keys missing from the
  locale, plus keys whose source value CHANGED since the locale was last
  touched (`git log -1 --format=%cI <locale file>`, then diff the source
  catalog over that window; when history is ambiguous, review the whole
  namespace the changed key sits in — siblings move together).
- **`new <locale>`** — adopt a language: bootstrap `style-<locale>.md` + the
  glossary column + exemplars, register the locale wherever the contract says
  locales are declared, then translate every key.

If no locale is given, operate on every non-source locale. **Log what you
skip** — a capped run that doesn't say so reads as "fully synced".

---

## The method — a three-pass loop per namespace batch

Single-pass translation is a ceiling. Run every batch through
**draft → estimate → refine**: translate it, audit it with a typed error
rubric, then rewrite ONLY what the audit flagged. The gate is the point —
unanchored "look again and improve" loops measurably *degrade* strings that
were already right.

### Pass A — Translate

Machine translation fails because it translates the *string*; you translate the
string **in its place in the product**. Batch by namespace/section so a whole
surface stays coherent. For each key:

1. **Locate the use.** Grep the call site (the contract says how). Read enough
   of the component to answer:
   - **Element type** → register + length. A button wants a short imperative; a
     heading a noun phrase; a tooltip a fuller hint; an `aria-label` a
     descriptive sentence; an error calm and actionable; a placeholder an
     example, not a command.
   - **Audience** → operator vs end-user/public pages (often different warmth).
   - **Siblings** → keys in the same object form one UI cluster; translate them
     as a set so terms and grammar agree.
   - **Length budget** → chip/pill/narrow column? Prefer the shorter idiomatic
     form; don't let a button wrap. German and French run 20–35% longer than
     English; plan for it.
2. **Classify → strategy.** *UI chrome*: concise, conventional, match the
   target OS/app idiom. *Body/marketing/empty-state*: **transcreate** — carry
   the feeling and rhythm, not the words; this is where literal dies.
   *Legal/consent*: precise, sober, preserve legally-loaded meaning.
   *Status/errors*: plain, non-alarming, actionable.
3. **Apply glossary + style guide + exemplars.** Canonical term for every
   domain word; the locale's register, casing, punctuation, plural rules; write
   *toward* the gold pairs' voice. Keep the translating frame terse — a
   one-line persona ("bilingual product copywriter for a <locale> B2B SaaS")
   beats a long translation brief, and chain-of-thought does not help the
   translate step.
4. **Preserve the format skeleton** exactly as the contract defines it: every
   placeholder byte-identical, plural branches expanded or frozen per the
   contract, tags/HTML/emoji kept. Move placeholders to where the target
   grammar wants them — that is usually a different position than English.
5. **Sanity-read as a native.** Would a native speaker write this on a real
   product, or does it smell of source-language word order? If unsure, mark it.

### Pass B — Estimate (typed MQM audit)

Fresh eyes on the batch Pass A just wrote — or, in `review` mode, on the
existing catalog. Audit each key and emit **zero or more typed errors**, not a
holistic verdict — error spans with category+severity correlate with native
judgment; "rate this 1–10" does not.

Per error record: `key · quoted span · category · severity · anchor · fix`.

Categories (MQM-derived):
- **accuracy** — mistranslation, omission, addition; wrong meaning in context.
- **terminology** — glossary term ignored, or one concept rendered two ways
  across the app.
- **fluency** — grammar (case, aspect, agreement), calque/source word order,
  register break (informal where the tool needs formal; stiff where an
  end-user page should be warm).
- **style** — reads translated rather than written; misses the exemplars' voice.
- **locale-convention** — Title Case aped from the source, wrong quote glyphs,
  straight `...` for `…`, missing NBSP, wrong/missing plural handling per the
  contract.
- **format** — lost/renamed placeholder, brace imbalance, translated syntax
  keyword, changed tag name. Always **critical**.
- **length** — visibly longer than source in a tight control.
- **leftover-source** — untranslated source text or a wrongly-translated brand
  term.

Severity: **critical** (wrong meaning, format break, legal/consent distortion) ·
**major** (a native speaker would stumble or be confused) · **minor** (polish).

**Every finding must cite an anchor** — a glossary row, a style-guide rule, an
exemplar, the contract's placeholder rules, a call-site length budget. A
finding with no anchor is taste, not an error; drop it or queue it for a
native. For high-visibility surfaces (nav, landing, empty states), ask one
extra localizer question per string: *would a native product team ship this
wording on this control?* — a style finding if the answer is no.

### Pass C — Refine (gated)

- Rewrite **only** keys with ≥1 **critical/major** error, feeding the error
  records into the rewrite. Re-check what you changed.
- **Minor**-only keys: apply the fix if mechanical (typography, casing);
  otherwise leave and note.
- Clean keys: **do not touch.** No drive-by rephrasing — churn on already-good
  strings is regression, not improvement.
- For genuinely ambiguous strings (a pun, a domain term with no settled local
  equivalent, a legal phrase), **don't guess silently**: apply your best
  version AND record it in `docs/i18n/review-<locale>.md` with its error
  record and severity, so a native speaker can triage. The user is not a
  native reviewer by default — surface these.

---

## Working at scale

- **Batch by namespace/section, not by string.** Load one section's source
  values + call sites, run the three passes on the whole cluster, write, move
  on. Keeps sibling grammar consistent and dodges the "lost in the middle"
  failure of one giant prompt. ~60–90 keys per batch is a good ceiling.
- Keep key order identical to the source catalog for reviewable diffs; edit
  namespace-block by namespace-block.
- **Skip dead keys** if the contract provides a dead-key check — never spend a
  token on a string no user can see.
- A **workflow / ultracode** fan-out is the natural shape for a full
  multi-locale sweep: one agent per (locale × section) chunk, each fed the four
  artifacts + call sites, then a parity/QA merge, with Pass C applied centrally
  so the catalog is never edited concurrently. Don't spin it up unprompted —
  offer it for big jobs.
- Never machine-blast a whole file in one edit; that's how silent format breaks
  and terminology drift ship.

---

## Guardrails (learned the hard way)

- **The source locale is the source of truth.** Don't edit source values to
  make a translation easier. Keep a running **source-defect list** instead and
  report it: hardcoded currency in translatable strings, sentences assembled by
  concatenation, flat strings that need plurals, duplicated catalogs — these
  cap quality for *every* locale and are the user's to fix.
- **Don't clobber good human translations.** In `review`/`sync`/`gaps`, change
  only what is wrong or missing; a wholesale overwrite of a reviewed catalog
  needs the user's OK first.
- **File hygiene** — valid JSON/format, UTF-8, real diacritics (`č`, `ř`, `ž`,
  not ASCII folds), the file's existing indentation, no trailing commas.
- **Emoji/symbols** in a value are content — keep them.
- **Numbers/dates/currency** are formatted at runtime — never hardcode a
  localized number; keep the placeholder and let the formatter do it.
- **Verify, don't assume.** A catalog that "looks translated" can still fail a
  gate on one plural — or silently render 24% source-language. Run every gate
  the contract lists, including post-edit build steps.
- **Known non-levers — don't drift into these.** Back-translation as a quality
  gate (fluent mistranslations round-trip cleanly; use it only as an
  omission/placeholder sanity check). Holistic 1–10 scoring (use typed errors).
  Long translation briefs (measured worse than a one-line persona). Extra
  refine loops beyond Pass C without new anchors (churn, not quality).

---

## Exit checklist

- [ ] Every gate in `docs/i18n/contract.md` passes, including post-edit build
      steps (a missed chunk-split/codegen ships a no-op).
- [ ] Touched locale files valid, same key order as source, proper diacritics.
- [ ] `docs/i18n/glossary.md` + `style-<locale>.md` updated with any new
      term/voice decisions; `exemplars-<locale>.md` exists and still holds the
      locale's best ~8; `contract.md` corrected if a run proved it stale.
- [ ] `docs/i18n/review-<locale>.md` updated: the strings worth a native second
      look, each with its typed error record and severity; anything
      capped/deferred named explicitly.
- [ ] The source-defect list surfaced to the user (flag only — never fixed
      silently).
- [ ] One-line summary: locale(s), keys audited/translated/fixed by severity,
      # queued for native review.

When every box is checked, the locale should read like it was written by a
person who uses the product every day — and the build stays green.

---

## Periodic operation

`sync` (plus `gaps`, where fallback is silent) is the heartbeat:
- **On change**: wire the contract's parity + untranslated checks into
  pre-commit/CI; any finding is the cue to run `/i18n-translate sync`.
- **On a schedule** (weekly / before a release): `/loop` or `/schedule` around
  `/i18n-translate sync all`.
- **New market**: `/i18n-translate new <locale>` once; it then joins the
  rotation automatically.

ARGUMENTS: `<mode> [locale] [scope]` — e.g. `review cs pipeline.controlCenter`,
`gaps all`, `full de`, `sync all`, `new pl`. Default with no mode: `review`
every non-source locale (after `gaps`, where the contract makes it relevant).
