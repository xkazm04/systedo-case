# Contributor License Agreement

> **Status: DRAFT — requires review by counsel before the repository is made
> public.** This document is adapted from the Apache Software Foundation's
> Individual Contributor License Agreement v2.0, a widely-used and
> widely-understood template. It has not yet been reviewed by a lawyer for this
> project, this maintainer or this jurisdiction (the maintainer is based in
> Czechia; the project is Czech-first). Do not rely on it as legal advice, and do
> not treat contributions as covered until this notice is removed.

## Why this exists

Adamant is released under **AGPL-3.0-only**. The AGPL governs what *you* may do
with the code. This agreement governs what the *maintainer* may do with the code
**you** contribute — and it exists for one specific reason:

The maintainer also offers a commercially-hosted version of this software. Under
AGPL-only contributions, a hosted service built on contributed code would sit on
uncertain ground, and any future relicensing (a change of open-source licence, a
dual-licence offering, an enterprise distribution) would require chasing down
every past contributor for permission. This agreement settles that at the point
of contribution instead.

The hosted version is not a better version of Adamant. It is the same code with
the operations handled — servers, backups, upgrades, and the provider credentials
(a Google Ads developer token, a Sklik token, an approved Meta app) that cannot
be shipped inside an open repository. Nothing is held back from the source tree
in order to sell it there. See [`docs/open-source/impact.md`](./docs/open-source/impact.md)
for where that line is drawn and why.

**You keep the copyright in your work.** You are granting rights, not signing
them away, and nothing here stops you from using your own contribution however
you like, including in other projects.

## Agreement

By submitting a Contribution to this project, You accept and agree to the
following terms for present and future Contributions.

**1. Definitions.** "You" means the copyright owner, or the legal entity
authorized by the copyright owner, entering into this agreement. "Contribution"
means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions
to an existing work, intentionally submitted by You to the maintainer for
inclusion in, or documentation of, this project. "Submitted" means any form of
electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the maintainer or its
representatives, including but not limited to communication on issue trackers,
pull requests, and mailing lists, excluding communication conspicuously marked or
otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

**2. Grant of Copyright Licence.** Subject to the terms of this agreement, You
grant to the maintainer and to recipients of software distributed by the
maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable copyright licence to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such
derivative works. **This licence is not limited to AGPL-3.0**: it permits the
maintainer to distribute Your Contribution under other licence terms, including
in a commercially-hosted or proprietary offering.

**3. Grant of Patent Licence.** You grant to the maintainer and to recipients of
software distributed by the maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
licence to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
transfer the Work, where such licence applies only to those patent claims
licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution alone or by
combination of Your Contribution with the Work to which it was submitted. If any
entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity alleging that
Your Contribution, or the Work to which You have contributed, constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licences granted to that
entity under this agreement for that Contribution or Work terminate as of the
date such litigation is filed.

**4. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above licence.**
If Your employer has rights to intellectual property that You create, You
represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of
that employer, that Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions,
or that Your employer has executed a separate corporate agreement.

**5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation.**
You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any
third-party licence or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related
patents and trademarks) of which You are personally aware and which are
associated with any part of Your Contributions.

**6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions**, except to
the extent You desire to provide support. Unless required by applicable law or
agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including,
without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

**7. You agree to notify the maintainer** of any facts or circumstances of which
You become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.

## A note on AI-assisted contributions

Much of this codebase was written with AI assistance and the maintainer has no
objection to yours. Clause 5 still applies unchanged: you are representing that
the Contribution is yours to grant. If a generator reproduced someone else's
licensed code into your patch, that is a third-party restriction you are expected
to know about and disclose. Review what you submit.

## How to sign

Once this agreement leaves draft: the CLA assistant bot comments on your first
pull request with a one-click signature flow. Signing once covers all your future
contributions to this project.

If you are contributing on behalf of a company, ask in the pull request and a
corporate agreement will be arranged instead.
